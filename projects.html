									<h2>Weather on brown dwarfs</h2>
									<p>Variability is common in brown dwarfs. As they rotate, any inhomogeneous atmospheric structure can cause variability in their light curves.
										Some Young L- and T- type brown dwarfs have similar masses, temperatures and ages as direct-imaged exoplanets. These free-floating planetary-mass objects are exoplanets analogues and are easier to observe than exoplanets because they are not obscured by close bright stars.
                    Studying their variability not only helps us understand atmospheric structures of young L and T dwarfs which are believed experiencing drastic cloud formation and condensation but also can be used to infer giant exoplanet atmospheres.
										<!-- We conduct a variability survey of young planetary-mass objects with ground-based telescopes. Combing previous variability surveys of field and young brown dwarfs, we can have a statistical analysis of their variability occurrence rates and thus investigate the effects of surface gravity on atmospheric structures.
										Furthermore, different wavelengths detect different atmospheric layers. Multiwavelength observations can reveal their vertical atmospheric structures. -->

									<h2>TRAP for vAPP</h2>
									<p>TRAP is a temporal systematics model for direct detection of exoplanets (Samland et al.2021). The vector Apodizing Phase Plate (vAPP) is a pupil-plane coronagraph that uses liquid crystals and direct writing techniques (Snik et al.2012; Otten et al.2014). Depending on the design, it can produce a dark hole with a centain shape in its point spread function (PSF), where is easier to search for exoplanets.
										We apply the TRAP algorithm to two types of vAPP datasets, gvAPP180 which procduces two PSFs with two 180-degree dark holes and dgvAPP360 which produces one PSF with a 360-degree dark hole.
										<!-- We provide examples of how to select reference pixels in the vAPP datasets and find that TRAP can achieve S/N consistent with the previous best algorithm implemented on the dgvAPP360 dataset and higher S/N than ADI which achieves the highest S/N on the gvAPP180 dataset previously. -->
