									<h2>Weather on brown dwarfs - a near-infrared variability survey of young planetary-mass objects</h2>
									<p>Variability is common in brown dwarfs. As they rotate, inhomogeneous atmospheric structures can be probed by variability monitoring.
									   Young brown dwarfs share similar mass, temperature and age with direct-imaged exoplanets. 
									   These free-floating planetary-mass objects are exoplanet analogues. Decade-long observations have revealed that brown dwarfs have complicated atmospheric structures possibly due to clouds, hotspots, and chemical-thermo instability.
									   It has been found that young L-dwarfs are more likely to be variable than field L dwarfs which is attributed to lower surface gravity.
									   To complete the statistical study on the effects of surface gravity on the variability of brown dwarfs from L to T spectral types, I conducted the first near-infrared variability survey of 18 young planetary-mass objects with spectral types from L5 to T8.
									   I detected four new variables and two variable candidates. 
									   Combining previous variability surveys of field and young L and T objects, I find that young objects tend to be more variable than field objects.
									   I constrained the variability rate of young T dwarfs for the first time and found that young T dwarfs are also more likely to be variable than field T dwarfs.
									   Both field and young samples have higher variability rates at the L/T transition than outside the L/T transition.
									   This work supports the critical role of surface gravity on the atmospheric structures of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects.

									<h2>TRAP for vAPP</h2>
									<p>TRAP is a temporal systematics model for direct detection of exoplanets (Samland et al.2021). The vector Apodizing Phase Plate (vAPP) is a pupil-plane coronagraph that uses liquid crystals and direct writing techniques (Snik et al.2012; Otten et al.2014). Depending on the design, it can produce a dark hole with a certain shape in its point spread function (PSF), where is easier to search for exoplanets.
										We apply the TRAP algorithm to two types of vAPP datasets, gvAPP180 which produces two PSFs with two 180-degree dark holes and dgvAPP360 which produces one PSF with a 360-degree dark hole.
										<!-- We provide examples of how to select reference pixels in the vAPP datasets and find that TRAP can achieve S/N consistent with the previous best algorithm implemented on the dgvAPP360 dataset and higher S/N than ADI which achieves the highest S/N on the gvAPP180 dataset previously. -->
